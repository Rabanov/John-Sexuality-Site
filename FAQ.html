                            <div>Then, each day, for the next 30 days, we’ll ask that you complete a much shorter daily survey, that should take you 5 minutes or less to complete. Don’t worry about having to remember—we’ll send you a prompt each day to complete the daily survey.</div>
                            <div>Lastly, we’ll ask you to place an iPod Touch in your bedroom, close to your bed (e.g., on a bed-side table); this iPod will be outfitted with psychological research software to capture audio around it. Beforehand, we’ll ask you and your partner at what time you normally retreat to your bedroom on a typical night, and program the iPod to automatically activate recording during this time, and deactivate afterwards—so you won’t need to do a thing. After 30 days, we’ll return to collect the iPod, and your participation in the study will be complete.</div>

We’ll also be creating a backup—just to be safe—of the audio data on a password-protected encrypted external drive that will also be stored in our lab under lock-and-key. Should we add additional external collaborators to our research team, they will only allow access to the data through secure and encrypted means.</div>
                          <div>We will also have a contact information list that will help us match couples’ background survey, daily-survey, and audio data. Once we have integrated all three of these data sources into one database, however, we will delete the contact information list—we’ll keep track of whose data is whose using randomized identification numbers. In other words, all identifiable paper records of you having participated, with the exception of the signed consent forms, will be deleted.</div>
                          <div>Finally, we will ask you if you are willing to let us use examples of audio, or written transcriptions of audio, as examples when giving presentations about our study, or for use in future studies. For example, some of your audio provides an excellent example of what “good relationship communication” actually sounds like; we may want to provide this example when presenting our results, or use it as part of a future study on relationship communication.</div>
                          <div>If you aren’t comfortable with us using your data in this way, you can still participate, and the only people who will review your audio recordings will be members of our research team.</div>
                          <div>And if you are comfortable with us using your audio data for examples or in subsequent studies, rest assured that we will obscure any audio containing identifiable information, and replace identifying text (e.g., your names) with suitable alternatives (e.g., pseudonyms) before using your data in this way.</div>

If you aren’t cohabiting with your partner, we aren’t going to get as much couple-related data from the audio recording as we’d like to. And the ethics of audio recording becomes much more complicated if there is the possibility that non-consenting (e.g., roommates) individuals or minors might unintentionally be recorded. Some of these recruitment decisions might change in our future studies, but for now, these recruitment decisions help to ensure that we get interesting data, but only from consenting adults. </div>
