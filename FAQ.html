                            Then, each day, for the next 30 days, we’ll ask that you complete a <i>much shorter</i> daily survey that should take you 5 minutes or less to complete. Don’t worry about having to remember—we’ll send you a prompt each day to complete the daily survey.

                            Lastly, we’ll ask you to place an iPod Touch in your bedroom, close to your bed (e.g., on a bed-side table); this iPod will be outfitted with psychological research software to capture audio around it. Beforehand, we’ll ask you and your partner at what time you normally retreat to your bedroom on a typical night, and program the iPod to automatically activate continuous recording during this time, and deactivate afterwards—so you won’t need to do a thing. After 30 days, we’ll return to collect the iPod, and your participation in the study will be complete.</p>

We’re interested in everything, from the big (e.g., what you talk about) to the small (e.g., the physical qualities of the audio, like pitch and tempo). Initially, we are most interested in understanding aspects of your sexual interactions with your partner, but but we think there is a lot that can be learned about relationships, generally speaking, from analyzing the audio of relationship interactions—sexual or otherwise—in their ‘natural environment’. </p>

                          Still, there may be days when something happens during the recording window that, for whatever reason, you <i>really</i> don’t want us researchers to be privy to. Should this happen, as long as you or your partner indicate on the next-day’s daily survey that you wish for the audio from that night to be deleted, we will ensure that the audio file is deleted when we pick up the iPod from you—we won’t ever hear what took place. If, however, you anticipate wanting to delete a lot of your audio files, as you participate, then perhaps this isn’t the study for you. Given our limited funding and the central importance of the audio recordings to our research goals, if we notice you are regularly requesting to delete your audio files, we may ask to pick up your iPod early and pay you for the portion of the study you have completed. </p>

                      <p> This is a really important question, and we take the privacy and data security aspects of our study very seriously.
                      <br><br>
                      We will be transferring the audio files from your iPod Touch (and then wiping the iPod’s memory) to a password-protected computer in our lab, behind locked doors, that has its hard drive encrypted, and is, for the most part, disconnected from the internet—this means that it won't be able to be remotely accessed or hacked when it is disconnected. Once we are prepared to analyze the audio data, we will temporarily connect the encrypted computer to the internet, so that our collaborators (who are audio analysis experts) can remotely access the audio files to help processing the data to get it ready for analysis. When this happens though, to be clear, the files will <i>never</i> be transferred to another computer—our collaborators will be using the internet to remotely control our encrypted lab computer. Once the audio data has been processed with the help of our collaborators, we will then disconnect our lab computer from the internet.
                      <br><br>
                      Your survey daily (both background and daily) will be collected using the industry-leading software Qualtrics. Rest assured that Qualtrics takes data security very seriously, and meets or exceeds all industry standards in terms of firewall protection and data encryption. Further, all of the survey data we collect using Qualtrics will be anonymous, so even if their security were to be breached, no one would be able to match your identity to your responses.
                      <br><br>
                      We’ll also be creating a backup — just to be safe — of the audio and survey data on a password-protected encrypted external drive that will also be stored in our lab under lock-and-key. Should we add additional external collaborators to our research team, they will only allow access to the data through secure and encrypted means.
                      <br><br>
                      We will also have a contact information list that will help us match couples’ background survey, daily-survey, and audio data. Once we have integrated all three of these data sources into one database, and the 6-month withdrawal period has ended, we will delete the contact information list — we’ll keep track of whose data is whose using randomized identification numbers. In other words, all identifiable paper records of you having participated, with the exception of the signed consent forms, will be deleted. And though we may be asked to share our data in the course of publishing this research in scientific journals (e.g., to verify our analyses are correct), we will only ever share the aggregated, anonymized database of numerical values; <b>we will <u>never</u></b> share complete raw audio files you provide with anyone outside of our research team.
                      <br><br>
                      Finally, we will ask you if you are willing to let us use snippets of audio, or written transcriptions of audio, as examples when giving presentations about our study, or for use in future studies. For example, some of your audio provides an excellent example of what “good relationship communication” actually sounds like; we may want to provide this example when presenting our results, or use it as part of a future study on relationship communication.
                      <br><br>
                      If you <u>aren’t comfortable</u> with us using your data in this way, <u>you can still participate, and the only people who will review your audio recordings will be members of our research team</u>.  Again, we will NEVER share the audio files with others unless you give us permission to do so, and only for the purposes of useful presentation examples and serving as stimuli in future studies.
                      <br><br>
                      And if you <u>are comfortable</u> with us using your audio data for examples or in subsequent studies, rest assured that <u>we will obscure any audio containing identifiable information, and replace identifying text (e.g., your names) with suitable alternatives (e.g., pseudonyms)</u> before using your data in this way.

Unfortunately, we’re only interested in collecting data from folks in a romantic relationship, and only if <i>both members</i> of a couple are willing and interested in participating. We may allow individuals to participate in a later version of the study, but for this first investigation, we will only be recruiting both members of a romantic couple. And if your partner at some point indicates that they want to withdrawal from the study, this will mean you will need to withdraw too; we don’t think it is respectful to collect data—especially audio—from your relationship if your partner is explicitly uncomfortable with it.</p>

                  <p>Good question. What constitutes “regular” sex varies from person to person, and couple to couple; what seems like frequent sex to some might seem like infrequent sex to others. We leave it up to you to decide what “regular” sex means, in the context of your relationship. However, we are hoping to have at least a few sexual episodes to analyze for each couple that participates over the course of 30 days in our research (some may have more, some may have less), so that is something to keep in mind when deciding whether this study is right for you.</p>

                  <p>These decisions about recruitment have largely been made because of pragmatic reasons. If you aren’t cohabiting with your partner, we aren’t going to get as much couple-related data from the audio recording as we’d like to. And the ethics of audio recording becomes much more complicated if there is the possibility that non-consenting (e.g., roommates) individuals or minors might unintentionally be recorded. Some of these recruitment decisions might change in our future studies, but for now, these recruitment decisions help to ensure that we get interesting data, but only from consenting adults. </p>
