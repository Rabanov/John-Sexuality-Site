                  In addition to the normal survey approach, we also want to collect audio recordings of your interactions with your romantic partner. Personality psychologists have been analyzing audio of people’s everyday lives for at least a decade, but we want to be the first to use this method to understand romantic relationships better. For example, on a typical relationship-related survey, you might indicate that you and your partner are “great sexual communicators”, but what does great sexual communication actually <i>sound</i> like, and how does it impact relationships? Are the particular spoken words what are important to promoting relationship quality? Or is more about the tone of voice used? Questions like these—and we have many—require us to actually <i>listen</i> to romantic relationship interactions in order begin searching for answers. At this point, many of the research questions that we find interesting and exciting are about the sexual experiences you have with your partner—like whether and how types of communication impact sexual satisfaction—but we anticipate being able to learn much from this data set about general relationship functioning and wellbeing.

                  So where do you come in? <u>If you live with your partner, think that you have sex with your partner “regularly” (whatever that means to you), and don’t have any children</u>, we’re asking you and your partner to consider participating in our month-long study—the first of its kind to employ this audio recording method to study romantic relationships. Over the course of a month, we’ll ask you both to:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <br>
                    <ol>
                          <li class="bullets">
                            …each complete a background survey taking approximately 45-60 minutes. This survey will consist of a number of surveys to measure aspects of your personality and qualities of your relationship
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="bullets">
                            …each complete short (~5 minutes) daily surveys, consisting of questions about your relationship activities and feelings in the past 24 hours.
                          </li>
                          <br>

                            Allow us to provide you with an iPod Touch with our audio-recording software installed, and to place this iPod near your bed, plugged into the wall so it stays charged. The audio-recording software will automatically activate during a window of time—provided by you—when you and your partner are typically in your bedroom, and will continuously record audio during this period of time.
                          </li>
                    </ol>

                  <br>
                   For completing all portions of the study, you and your partner will each be given $40 (pro-rated if you do not participate for the full 30 days). Check out our <i>Frequently Asked Questions</i> page to get more details on things like how we will protect your data, why we’re only recruiting cohabiting relationships without children, and other questions you may have.
